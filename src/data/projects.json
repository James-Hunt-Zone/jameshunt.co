Users can pick from hundreds of assets ensuring a wide variety of avatars get submitted. Once on the screen, there's a vast array of animations from waving and dancing to doing the conga.\n\nThe project deliverables consisted of a microsite where users could build and sumbit an avitar.  Along side this, the Flash application powered the screen at Piccadilly. This application had a wide variety of animations to bring your avitar to life, along with sessional changes built in, a queuing system where it responds to the amount of avatars waiting and other effects.\n\nLittle Piccadilly was listed as 1 of the top 10 digital Innovations by Campaign Magazine in the annual 2014 edition.",
