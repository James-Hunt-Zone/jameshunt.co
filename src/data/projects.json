This application had a wide variety of animations to bring your avitar to life, along with sessional changes built in, a queuing system where it responds to the amount of avatars waiting and other effects.\n\nLittle Piccadilly was listed as 1 of the top 10 digital Innovations by Campaign Magazine in the annual 2014 edition.",
